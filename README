I made this program to make the graphics for Sheen (https://github.com/Erhannis/Sheen).  I release this under the Apache License 2.0.  Go forth.

This program was written much more for internal use, so it's much scribblier than Sheen.

It uses PngJ for generating png files.

Dang, I suddenly realized that it also uses one of my other internal libraries.  I guess I'll have to put that up, too.  It'll probably be found at https://github.com/Erhannis/MathNStuff.
